# Fractal Viewer

Generates the Mandelbrot fractal and shows it, allowing to zoom in, zoom out and move around using a GUI. To use it simply run the `run.sh` shell file. The focus was **simplicity**, not performance. 

## Structure of the code

1. **A C++ Script** (generate.cpp): this script crunches the numbers required to make the image and outputs the result in a file
2. **A Python Script** (fractal.py): this script does everything else. It creates the GUI, invokes the C++ script to generate the numbers, creates the image from those numbers using a nice gradient, and allows the user to zoom and move around.

Origally, the numbers were generated by Python, but re-writing as C++ took a couple of minutes but significantly improved the performance (my guess is 5x faster, at a minimum)

## Output

Here's the kind of images it can generate:
